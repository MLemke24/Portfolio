        <p>
            I am 31 years old and currently living in south texas. I have a wife named Alexis and we have been married 3 years. No kids yet but our dogs are spoiled like a child. I have always enjoyed a challenge but as a kid, I was not a sports guy. That is when I found puzzles. Nothing is better for me than taking something broken and working it until it comes back together.
